When adding more packages inside the project, we need every package to have the current version of the next.js version to set its version
Go to package.json file and add

"packageManager": "npm@10.5.2",
   "overrides": {
    "react": "$react",
    "react-dom": "$react-dom"
   },


For authentication go to auth.js and
install the following packages -->
npm install next-auth@beta
npx auth secret


now add configuration as shown in the docs
